    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Ocheme Blessing Ehi and I am a UI/UX designer/ Front-End Web
      Developer with a strong foundation in business strategy and a creative
      flair for user-centered digital experiences.. My journey into tech was
      fueled by my natural curiosity, eye for detail, and a desire to solve
      problems that make people’s lives easier. With a background in Business
      Administration and my personal experience in running a braiding business,
      it gives me deep insight into what both customers and service providers
      truly need. I bring a unique blend of business strategic and design
      thinking to every project I work on. My goal is simple: to create
      seamless, visually appealing, and meaningful digital experiences that
      solve real user problems. Whether I’m coding a new feature or bringing to
      life a new design, I’m always thinking about how to deliver the best
      experience. If you're looking to collaborate on a design or development
      project, or just want to connect, I’d love to hear from you.
